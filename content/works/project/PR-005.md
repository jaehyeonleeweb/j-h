*JH Web Duo* is an open-source font based on the [Duospaced](/thought/th-003/) structure, created for [*this web*](https://j-h-a-r-c-h-i-v-e.com/). This font features 2,574 Hangul characters[^1] selected by Noh Minji and Yoon Mingoo in their *Proposal for Additional Korean Characters in Complete Code System of Hangeul*. Furthermore, all glyphs in this font use only two fixed widths: full-width for Hangul and some punctuation marks, and half-width for Latin uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and the remaining punctuation marks. The full-width width is 920 units (based on 1000 units per full-width box), while the half-width width is half that, at 460 units.
<br><br>
*JH Web Duo* is a combination of three open-source fonts,[^2] distributed under the OFL license.[^3] The 2,574 Hangul glyphs comprising this font are sourced from [*Spoqa Han Sans Neo*](https://spoqa.github.io/spoqa-han-sans/). The Latin uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and most punctuation marks come from [*Iosevka*](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/) Monospace. The quotation marks and related punctuation are sourced from [*Roboto Mono*](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono). Subsequent adjustments to sidebearings and outline shapes completed the entire font.
<br><br>
The method for combining the three fonts into one is as follows. First, using the horizontal width of *Spoqa Han Sans Neo* (or its prototype, Noto Sans) with a fixed-width system—920 units—as the full-width standard, the two fixed widths for the Duospaced structure are set. (At this point, full-width is 920 units and half-width is 460 units.) The width of *Iosevka* glyphs, which have a fixed width of 500 units, is readjusted to 460 units. (Care was taken to maintain the left-right ratio of the side bearings.) Additionally, to achieve shapes for other punctuation marks that harmonize with the overall glyphs, some punctuation glyphs from *Roboto Mono* were borrowed and refined to complete the set.
