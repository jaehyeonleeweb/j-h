Designed in 1000-unit blocks, Dongle is composed of two fundamental elements: a straight line with a thickness of 100 units and a circle with a radius of the same size. Dongle mimics a kind of Art Nouveau style through the combination of these simple structures. This is particularly pronounced in the display font.
<br><br>
Dongle is distributed as a demo version with two type families: Regular for body text and Line for display. It is planned to be developed into five type families. The Dongle Line consists of a 50-unit thick line that wraps twice around the basic skeleton of Dongle Regular. The Dongle demo includes Roman alphabet uppercase and lowercase letters, Arabic numerals, punctuation, and basic special characters.
