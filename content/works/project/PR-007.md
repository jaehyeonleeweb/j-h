*DCT Flux* is a web project that endlessly generates flowing images by applying the principles of DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform), a technique used in JPEG image compression. The ambiguous, murky, and speckled grayscale images produced by *DCT Flux* may momentarily appear to depict recognizable objects, but they are in fact an aggregation of neutral, impersonal pixels composed of random frequency values. 
<br><br>
If one could watch *DCT Flux* forever, it might be possible to imagine every form in the world at least once. If so, then surely—at the very least, once—Kazimir Malevich’s Black Square (or maybe Black Rectangle) would appear.
