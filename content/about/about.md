This web is my online archive.  
[I](/contact/contact/) hope the materials archived here will intertwine like a net, forming a thicket-like structure.
<br><br>
The structure of this web:

> 1. This web documents practices related to images. It consists of two layers.[^1]
> 		1. This web records workshop practices—ideas put into practice through workshops.
> 			1. All workshops aim to explore the concept of [Potential Images](/thought/th-001/), borrowed from Oulipo's ‘Potential Literature’.[^2] The purpose of these practices is to enable images to reveal their own potential through constraint-based attempts.
> 			2. I actively embrace the Oulipian stance, though I sometimes apply it loosely. What is always important to me is the new.
> 		2. This web documents the outcomes of personal projects (sometimes commissioned work)—often alongside the process and its trial and error.
> 			1. Of course, the generation and development of motifs during the process are always sporadic.[^3] Therefore, a complete record is impossible. Yet, despite omissions and exaggerations, I imagine the various pairs of connections that a record of the process might create. The concepts that follow will give birth to new motifs.
<br><br>
> 2. This web documents what lay behind the practice. It consists of three layers.
> 		1. This web also documents the methods of practice.
> 			1. Every practice has a method of execution. It exists between the creator's intention and the outcome. The method mediates the countless connections between intention and result.
> 		2. This web also documents my thoughts.
> 			1. Every practice begins with a few minor ideas. Thoughts resonate with each other and grow in scale.
> 		3. This web also records (quotes) a glossary.
> 			1. It records the original text of quoted information along with its surrounding context. Every thought has roots.


[^1]: The practices can be verified in the *works*.

[^2]: See the [Lipo: First Manifesto](/glossary/gl-001/).

[^3]: See the 11th item among [Sentences on Conceptual Art](/glossary/gl-002/). The statements by Sol LeWitt cited here separate the motif (idea) of the work from the production process, establishing an explicit hierarchy between the two. However, I prioritize the separation itself. The novelty created by the serendipity of the production process is always intriguing.
