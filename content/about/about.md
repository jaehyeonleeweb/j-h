**About the Overview**<br>  
[This Web](https://j-h-a-r-c-h-i-v-e.com/) records images [I](/contact/contact/) have created. [this web](https://j-h-a-r-c-h-i-v-e.com/) will form a web-like network of relationships between images (true to its name). Moreover, [this web](https://j-h-a-r-c-h-i-v-e.com/) records the underlying contexts to foster sticky, tenacious, persistent connections between images. It may be another image, or it may not be an image at all. It may be something I created, or it may not be something I created. Therefore, [this web](https://j-h-a-r-c-h-i-v-e.com/) pursues the viscosity of things—whether created by me or not, whether images or not. How viscous can this web truly become?
<br><br> 

**Regarding Graphic Design Images**<br>
Before describing the images I create, I feel I must first define the scope of this discussion. For now, I wish to call these graphic design images. This is to narrow the scope before the speculative explanations that follow obscure the definition of these images.[^1] So, the scope of these images (burdened with the cumbersome label of ‘design’) might be considered as follows:

> 1. Images created in response to someone's commission/request
> 2. Images created (though no one requested them) that serve a specific purpose
> 3. Images created (though no one requested them) that lack any specific purpose (or appear to lack one)

The first represents the most common, universal interpretation of design images. A designer with a fairly distinct sense of agency would likely include their own work up to the second category. However, in the third category, the boundaries of the term “design” begin to blur. Some might firmly declare these images have long since departed the realm of design.
<br><br>
For those who define ‘design/designer’ as a purely professional term, there are plenty of valid reasons why the third category cannot be called a design image. Especially for designers suffering through overtime in the real world—those handling design tasks dictated by company directives or client demands—considering anything beyond the first category might feel like a waste of time. But even the most pragmatic designer, when faced with design work undertaken without request (whether for employment, career change, academic purposes, portfolio building, or personal interest...), should reconsider the meaning behind their actions. To put it bluntly, let's answer this question: How far does the line extend for images a designer is ‘allowed’ to create?
<br><br>
While there's no fascist doctrine written anywhere dictating the roles and duties every designer must follow, individual designers clearly work according to their own standards. (Even if they aren't consciously aware of it.) Unfortunately, in my case, establishing those standards wasn't easy. For quite a long time, while creating numerous images, I hesitated in my work because I couldn't easily abandon the belief (though it made me uncomfortable) that a designer should create images that offer at least a ‘minimal’ contribution (to the world). (Even if it's not something as grand as professional ethics) I wanted to hold myself to a certain standard, at least regarding the meaning of my daily actions—that is, I wanted to maintain a professional consciousness I could be proud of. That's why I couldn't simply set my own criteria.
<br><br>
Actually, at this point, I must confess that I started [this web](https://j-h-a-r-c-h-i-v-e.com/) to give myself confidence—to reassure myself that I'm not just creating images that seem utterly useless. Because I suspect that gathering these scattered thoughts and works together will reveal some kind of outline. For the future of [this web](https://j-h-a-r-c-h-i-v-e.com/), the question discovered so far (one that's difficult to answer clearly) is this: Among the three classifications of graphic design images mentioned earlier, are images that fall into the third category truly valuable? Or, if someone were to acknowledge its value, wouldn't it instantly transform into a second-category image? If so, are all third-category images merely dormant, holding the potential to be promoted to the second category? Or could images that stubbornly persist in the third category somehow exist?
<br><br>

**Regarding the images I create**<br>
The types of images I create are as follows. (In this classification, the previously mentioned motivation for image creation—whether it stems from someone's request—is (for now) not a significant consideration.)

> 1. Project
> 2. Workshop
> 	1. Workshop Practice

A *Project* signifies a one-off, temporary endeavor. Of course, while working, multiple tasks can become interconnected (even without my awareness). But since these connections are not intentional, let's consider them standalone. Each project has its own theme, and even if some projects appear similar, they are not identical.
<br><br>
In contrast, a *Workshop* is a format designed to consciously explore variations on a single theme. The theme presented in each *Workshop Practice* leads to *Workshop Practice* (through research or sometimes intuition). Therefore, multiple *Workshop Practice* follow from a single *Workshop Practice*. As Sol LeWitt stated, for each work of art that becomes physical (or non-physical), there are many unrealized variations,[^2] the goal of each practice becomes realizing the workshop's theme as one possible manifestation.
<br><br>
The images thus created still do not provide a clear answer to the question of the image's utility mentioned earlier. If these images pursue one alternative goal, it is the [Potential image](/thought/th-001/). In the spirit of latent literature, I seek to reveal the latent potential inherent in the image through constraint-based (and sometimes unconstrained) methods. (Of course, revealing this potential may fail.)
<br><br>

**Regarding things I made or did not make, made only partially, are images or are not images, or are only partially images**<br>
Behind the images lie many things. Their types are as follows.

> 1. Method
> 2. Thought
> 3. Glossary

*Method* refers to the ways in which the images were created. The reason for recording these here is to present the ‘conditions of production’ of the work as equally significant alongside the work itself. As LeWitt noted, the concept of a work of art may involve the material of the work or the process by which it is made.[^3] Moreover, the Oulipian constraints (or program) used to explore the potential of [Potential images](/thought/th-001/) reinforce the work's programming nature. Ultimately, the *Method* (of creating the image) is inevitably and firmly bound to the image itself (regardless of my creative intent), and thus I judged it natural to record it alongside the work.
<br><br>  
*Thought* are primarily related to images, though they may not always be. Nevertheless, every thought always carries the potential to be realized as an image. The direction of this realization cannot be intended, but once realized, it will inevitably create new connections in some way. Therefore, recording thoughts becomes a necessary condition for this chain. (To reiterate) According to LeWitt, the perception of ideas leads to new ideas.[^4]
<br><br>
*Glossary* connect to both the previously mentioned images and non-images. This (in almost all cases) pertains to things I did not create, yet the process of selecting what to bring onto [this web](https://j-h-a-r-c-h-i-v-e.com/) is not fundamentally different from the countless decisions made when creating an image. Furthermore, the very fact of being posted on [this web](https://j-h-a-r-c-h-i-v-e.com/) assigns a new location to this document (disconnected from its original context). Therefore, references are not merely supplementary materials called upon by what I have created; they become potential documents capable of ascending unexpected paths.
