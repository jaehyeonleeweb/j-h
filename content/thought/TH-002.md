As of 2025, low-resolution photos of unknown origin haunt the internet like ghosts. At first glance, these images appear to be vintage shots taken with entry-level digital cameras in the early 2000s. Yet I hesitate to confidently pinpoint their creation date—I’ve been fooled by such photos too many times. Some photos clearly possess the aesthetic of that era—the distinctive, degraded colors and image quality typical of budget digital cameras—yet feature objects or brands from the 2020s. It’s not a huge twist. Probably because the Y2K craze sweeping the 2020s has led many to use vintage cameras from past eras. The problem lies in the nostalgia these photos carry. I find myself captivated by this intense nostalgia. Whether the images are genuinely from the past or faked to mimic it, the nostalgia works. (At least for me.) So, is what I’m feeling a genuine longing for my childhood experiences in the early 2000s? Or is it merely a fake longing—triggered by some mechanical chemical reaction—to degraded, low-resolution, lost, vintage, old, hazy, faded, incomplete, blurred, smudged, noise-filled images? Like the brain’s deception from electrical stimulation in the Matrix universe?
