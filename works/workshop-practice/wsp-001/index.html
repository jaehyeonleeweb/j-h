    <p><strong>0. On Image Synthesis</strong><br>
As discussed in the <a href="/works/workshop/ws-001/">Workshop about “Synthesizer”</a>, the synthesis principle of synthesizers is based on the sum of frequencies. I aim to bring this principle into the realm of visual images rather than audio. Before proceeding, let’s address a few conditions.
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>1. Fundamental Elements of Images</strong><br>
While the basic element of audio synthesis can be simply defined as a sine wave, no such foundational element readily comes to mind in the world of images. How should we find it?<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-1-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>
<br><br>
Let’s acknowledge that dealing with images is more complex than dealing with sound. Unlike sound, which consists solely of one-dimensional waves, an image is a two-dimensional spatial concept with x and y axes. Therefore, the frequency of visual information becomes more complex in its directionality. Furthermore, the eye’s resolution is far higher than that of the ear. In other words, it has higher resolution. These two facts mean that the amount of information we must interpret—or convey—from visual images is greater than that from sound.
<br><br>
The purpose of this practice is not to clearly define every attribute of an image. That is far too vast a subject. It suffices to speculate within limited scope on how image synthesis might function. For example, no synthesizer in the world strictly adheres to the fundamental principle that all sounds can be produced solely through the synthesis of sine waves. This is because it is nearly impossible to prepare the countless oscillators needed to fully capture the world’s complexity. Therefore, this practice aims to adopt one approach to image synthesis and explore its potential.
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>2. Image Attributes</strong><br>
First, let us categorize image attributes into three types.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-2-1"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Color</li>
<li>Form</li>
<li>Texture</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Among these, color is relatively distinct from the other attributes, but the remaining two are not. If form refers to specific shapes or boundaries within an image, texture could be defined as patterns or variations in density within specific areas of the image. While these definitions are fairly clear within the realm of human intuition, they are challenging to translate into precise mechanical criteria. Consequently, in the process of applying the principles of JPEG compression used in this practice, texture and form will be defined somewhat indistinctly. We will exclude discussions on color and limit our scope to the synthesis of shape alone—combining form and texture under this term.
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>3. JPEG Compression and DCT</strong><br>
The JPEG compression method (hereafter JPG) is the most widely used standard among lossy compression techniques for reducing the file size of digital images.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-3-1"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> Simply put, JPG reduces storage capacity by treating information poorly recognized by the human eye as unimportant—blurring or deleting it—a process known as lossy compression. In this process, JPG divides image information into two major categories for processing: color and shape.
<br><br>
JPG processes color by separating it into luminance (brightness) and chrominance (color) information. Brightness information is considered more important than color information because the human eye is more sensitive to changes in brightness. Consequently, JPG reduces storage space by sacrificing (subsampling) color information. Compressed digital images lose some actual color information, but this difference is difficult to discern clearly with the naked eye. Consequently, JPG becomes an efficient compression method that defends against visual quality degradation of the original image while reducing actual data.
<br><br>
The process by which JPG handles shape is more complex. First, JPG divides the entire image into 8×8 pixel blocks for processing. Each block is then compressed independently. (The blocky appearance in digital images, often called JPEG artifacts, arises during this process.) During compression, these 8×8 pixel blocks are converted into a combination of 64 basic patterns using a method called the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). This converts spatial domain information into frequency domain information, which is also related to the hierarchy of information discernible by the human eye. We perceive low-frequency components, which form the large structures of an image, well, but we do not perceive high-frequency components, which are detailed and have complex shape changes, as well. Therefore, JPG increases compression efficiency by sacrificing the high-frequency components in the transformed 8×8 pixel frequency domain.

  <figcaption>JPG image, You can see the JPEG artifacts</figcaption>
</figure>
<br><br>
<p><strong>4. Discrete Cosine Transform</strong><br>
JPG’s DCT follows these steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>An 8×8 pixel block has 64 basic patterns (DCT coefficients). <sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-4-1"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></li>
<li>The original image is divided into 8×8 pixel blocks, and the information from each block is read.</li>
<li>The block’s information is converted into 64 weighted coefficients for the patterns via DCT.</li>
<li>The 64 patterns are combined according to these weights to reconstruct the block’s image.</li>
<li>The compression ratio varies depending on how much high-frequency information is sacrificed.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

  <figcaption>Basic patterns in a DCT block (8×8)</figcaption>
</figure>
<br><br>
<p><strong>5. Image Generation Using DCT (DCT Resynthesis)</strong><br>
If DCT compresses images, it should also be possible to reverse this process to generate images. This practice originated from this idea.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-5-1"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>
<br><br>
As previously noted, the Discrete Cosine Transform yields 64 DCT coefficients. The ultimate goal is to combine these to obtain a shape image, but an 8×8 grid presents too many possibilities for experimentation. Therefore, we decided to control the variables for the experiment. The experimental conditions are as follows. <sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-6-1"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The format of the generated shape image is set to 4×4 pixels.</li>
<li>The generated shape image is composed of a combination of four 2×2 pixel blocks.</li>
<li>Consequently, each 2×2 pixel block possesses one of four basic patterns (DCT coefficients).</li>
<li>By limiting weights to 0 and 1, generate all possible images within these constraints.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Accordingly, I obtained 4 basic patterns and 1,808 shape images. These represent all possible images under the experimental conditions.
<br><br></p>

  <img src="/media/works/workshop-practice/wsp-001/dct 2x2 Basics.webp" alt="dct 2×2 basics">
  <figcaption>Four basic patterns (A 2×2 pixel block’s DCT coefficient has four possible cases based on weights 0 and 1.)</figcaption>
</figure>
<br><br>
The number of ways to combine 2×2 DCT coefficients to create a 4×4 image can be summarized as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>A: An image filled entirely with the same basic 2×2 pattern<br>
B: Image filled with two different patterns, each occupying half the space<br>
C: Image filled with one pattern occupying 3 cells and another pattern occupying 1 cell<br>
D: Image filled with one pattern occupying 2 cells, another pattern occupying 1 cell, and yet another pattern occupying 1 cell<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-7-1"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup></p>

<br><br>
<p><strong>6. Practice Postscript</strong><br>
Through this series of processes, I sought to demonstrate that concrete images can be generated through the synthesis of abstract fundamental elements. However, the shape images produced as a result of this practice still have the limitation of not significantly departing from abstraction. Nevertheless, I am confident that these images exemplify the DCT principle as a potential methodology for image synthesis. In subsequent practices, I will further develop this methodology to obtain more concrete and useful form images. Moreover, the form images generated in this way can be connected to various contexts. For example, how do form images generated as the sum of frequencies through a specific methodology differ from AI-generated images using the Stable Diffusion method? Can Stable Diffusion, which is also based on learned data, be considered a form of “synthesis”? These questions clearly remind us of the potential inherent in <a href="/thought/th-001/">potential images</a>.</p>
